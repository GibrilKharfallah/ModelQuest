# 📈 ModelQuest : A Supervised Learning Project

ModelQuest is a complete machine learning pipeline using **supervised learning** techniques in Python, leveraging the `scikit-learn` library.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation and comparison of models
- Visualization of results

The goal of the project is to compare the performance of multiple classifiers and evaluate their effectiveness on a structured dataset.

## 📊 Algorithms Used

The project likely includes some of the following models (to be updated based on actual content):

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn geopy asyncio PIL folium webbrowser concurrent tkinter
```

## 📁 Usage

- Clone the repository or download the notebook.
- Open `Projet.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run the cells step-by-step to follow the analysis and model training.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using various metrics such as:

- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Cross-validation scores
